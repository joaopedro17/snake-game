## Instructions

If you have all the files in the same folder, you just need to open the `snake.html` file.

If you want a little more challenge, just change the divisor on the `gameLoop()` function. Higher the value, faster the snake gets.

Exemple code below.

```js
function gameLoop()
{
    setInterval(show, 1000/20) // here 20 is the value to change
}
```
